1. Download the dataset from above link.
2. Apply Preprocessing
   Normalization pixel values between 0-1.
   Convert images into 28x28 if not in specified shape.
   Convert images to greyscale, if not already,
   Google for other preprocessing steps and apply them.
   Split into train and test.
3. Develop a neural network with 3 Hidden layers and 1 output layer.
   Neurons in layer 1: 1000
   Neurons in layer 2: 500
   Neurons in layer 3: 250
   Neurons in output layer: (Decide it by yourself)
4. Train Model with different number of epochs until you get the test accuracy above 95%.
5. Report Confusion matrix and test accuracy
